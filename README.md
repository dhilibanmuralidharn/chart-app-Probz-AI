# Introduction
  This is a React application that fetches data from a local JSON file and displays it in a line chart using the Recharts library. Users can select different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) to view the data and export the chart as a PNG image.

# Features
  Data Fetching: Fetches data from a local JSON file.
  Data Visualization: Displays data in a responsive line chart.
  Timeframe Selection: Allows users to view data in daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes.
  Chart Export: Users can export the chart as a PNG image.
  Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling

# Installation
# Install dependencies: npm install
# Install Tailwind CSS: npm install -D tailwindcss, npx tailwindcss init
# Configure Tailwind CSS: Add the following content to your tailwind.config.js file:
    module.exports = {
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

 # Add Tailwind CSS to your CSS: Add the following lines to your src/index.css file:
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    
# Prepare the data file: Ensure you have a data.json file in the public directory.  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Usage
  Select Timeframe: Use the dropdown to select the timeframe you want to view (Daily, Weekly, Monthly).
  Export Chart: lick the "Export Chart" button to download the chart as a PNG image.

# Project Structure
  `src/`: Contains the main source code for the React application
          App.js: The main component of the application.
          App.css: CSS styles for the application.
          index.css: Tailwind CSS imports and configurations.
  public/: Contains static files, including the data.json file.

# Dependencies
  React, Recharts, date-fns, html2canvas, Tailwind CSS

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
